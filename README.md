# Kenya Agro-Weather Yield Predictor
Developed an AI-powered crop yield prediction system for Kenyan farmers using Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask. Collected 10,000+ weather records, trained ML models achieving 80% accuracy, and deployed an interactive web application.


# Overview

This project uses Machine Learning to predict crop yields for **Maize, Beans, and Groundnuts** across Kenyan counties based on:
- Historical weather patterns (2015-2024)
- Soil properties
- Growing seasons
- Climate conditions

# Live Demo
Web application with interactive predictions


# Key Features

Real Weather Data- 10,000+ records from Open-Meteo API

- ML Model - Random Forest with 80% accuracy (RÂ² = 0.80)
- 3 Counties - Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru
- 3 Crops- Maize, Beans, Groundnuts
- Web Interface - User-friendly prediction dashboard
- 180+ Training Samples- Robust model training
